"# Q) Train, Test and plot the performance curvesfor the followingarchitecturesoverthe MNIST datasetas well as the CIFAR-10 dataset.1. Design a CNN with:a) One Convolution layer which uses 32 kernels each of size 5x5, stride = 1 and, padding =0b)One Pooling layerwhich uses MAXPOOLINGwith stride =2.c) One hidden layer having number of neurons = 100Note: use ReLUactivation function after each convolution layer.2. Design a CNN with:a) Two back-to-backConvolution layerswhich uses 32 kernels each of size 3x3, stride = 1 and, padding =0b)One Pooling layer which uses MAXPOOLING with stride =2.c) One hidden layer having number of neurons = 100Note: use ReLU activation function after each convolution layer.3. Design the LeNet-5 architecture (see fig below)4. Compare the performances of theabove three architectures with respect to the two datasets."
